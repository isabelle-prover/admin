Architecture
============

The purpose of this configuration is to bootstrap a set of machines to a defined state.
Bootstrapping is idempotent: running it twice on the same machines is the same as running it once.
In most cases, it is also incremental: if change it monotonically, we can re-apply bootstrapping and get the same result as bootstrapping a machine from a pristine state.
The only assumption is that we never manually configure the machines, i.e. logging in via SSH and performing arbitrary commands in Bash.

.. note::

  There are of course exceptions to this rule, for example in emergencies (downtime).


Overview
--------

There are three kinds of servers:

1. The central server is the *leader*, which runs on a low-resource virtual machine.
   It mainly hosts an Apache web server and the Jenkins instance.
   It performs regular polling of the repositories and starts and coordinates builds on the workers.

2. *Workers* require a lot of resources.
   There are various kinds of workers with different configuration based on hosting provider and OS platform.

3. The *AFP submission* system is a single, low-end machine.
   The leader acts as a proxy for that machine.
