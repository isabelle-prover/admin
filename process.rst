Security updates
----------------

Security updates should be applied regularly.
The most critical part of the infrastructure is the Jenkins instance which is exposed to the Internet.
It is highly recommended to follow the `Jenkins Security Advisories <https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories>`_.
In contrast, the LRZ worker VMs are only exposed to the MWN and are not reachable from the Internet.
